# Booking App REST API

A secure and efficient RESTful API for a booking application, built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and enhanced with JWT authentication and password hashing using Bcrypt.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using Bcrypt before storage, ensuring sensitive data protection.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Utilizes Mongoose for seamless interaction with MongoDB, ensuring efficient data management.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized codebase with separate controllers, models, routes, and utility functions for maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable network applications.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js, facilitating the creation of robust APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward way to model data.
- **Bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords, enhancing security by protecting user credentials.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, used here for secure authentication.
